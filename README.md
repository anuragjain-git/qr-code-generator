# URL to QR Code Generator

This project uses Node.js to accomplish three tasks:
1. Get user input using the `inquirer` npm package.
2. Convert the user-entered URL into a QR code image using the `qr-image` npm package.
3. Save the user input to a text file using the native `fs` module.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes npm).

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anuragjain-git/qr-code-generator.git

   cd qr-code-generator
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install inquirer qr-image
   ```

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Run the script:
   ```sh

2. You will be prompted to enter a URL:

   ```

3. After entering the URL, the following will happen:
